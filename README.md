# The-Great-Big-Adventure
My first bit of programming. A text based adventure game with aliens, guns, bowling, and toast. I wrote the entire game in one day.
Please enjoy!

All programming performed in C++. This game is free to anyone who would like it. 

Inputs in the game are all single numbers 1 thourgh 9. When you would like to exit, enter the word 'exit'.
